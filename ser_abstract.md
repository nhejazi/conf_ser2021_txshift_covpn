While promising vaccine efficacy assessments have softened the critical
landscape surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, many critical open questions
remain. In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which existing vaccines have
achieved remarkable protection against symptomatic and significant COVID-19
infection, and to better align the development of next-generation (protective)
vaccines, careful study of immune correlates of protection is imperative. As
measurements of the post-vaccination levels of such immune markers are
quantitative, the most common tools of statistical causal inference, which
require binary exposures and TODO, cannot be readily utilized. To complicate
such analyses further, vaccine efficacy trials generally employ two-phase
sampling of such immune markers, necessitating careful downstream adjustment for
formal statistical inference. Stochastic shift interventions define the target
parameter as the mean counterfactual outcome under hypothetically shifted
versions of the observed immune correlates activity distribution.

We present a novel framework for use in evaluating vaccine efficacy:
nonparametric-efficient, multiply robust estimators of causal vaccine efficacy
effects based on stochastic shift interventions, augmented to two-phase
sampling. Our effect definitions open the door to asking how the risk for
symptomatic disease would change across various (counterfactual) levels of
activity of immune correlates of protection, similar, in principal, to
a dose-response analysis. Our proposed methodology incorporates corrections for
censored outcomes in the vaccine arm of the trial and, unlike prior proposals,
defines effects by comparing risk in the vaccine arm to that in the control arm.
We demonstrate our proposed immune correlates analysis using data produced by
the COVID-19 Vaccine Prevention Network, illustrating how the post-vaccination
immunogenicity of XYZ may be quantified across a grid of possible shifts.
