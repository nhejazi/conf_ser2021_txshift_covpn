Promising initial efficacy assessments of vaccine candidates for COVID-19 have
made for a promising start to curbing the pandemic. A critical next step is
identifying immune correlates of protection, and their use in the development of
future (protective) vaccine candidates. Deploying the tools of statistical
causal inference in service of such goals is hindered by the historical focus of
the field on binary exposures and static interventions, which cannot be readily
applied to _quantitative_ immune correlates measurements without simplifying
assumptions. Stochastic interventions, which define the target parameter as the
mean counterfactual outcome under hypothetically shifted versions of the
observed immune correlates distribution, hold promise for circumventing such
difficulties. Complicating analytic efforts further, vaccine efficacy trials
often employ two-phase sampling of immune correlates, necessitating careful
downstream adjustment for formal statistical inference.

We present a novel framework for evaluating vaccine efficacy through immune
correlates of protection: nonparametric-efficient, multiply robust estimators of
_causal_ vaccine efficacy based on stochastic interventional effects, which
treat immune correlates as mediators of the effect of vaccination on disease.
Our effect definitions quantify how disease risk would change across
(counterfactual) shifts in the observed immunogenicity levels of immune
correlates, similar, in principal, to a dose-response analysis. Our framework
readily incorporates corrections for two-phase sampling and right-censoring of
disease endpoints, and conveniently defines vaccine efficacy by comparing
counterfactual risks in the vaccine versus placebo arms. Using example data from
the COVID-19 Vaccine Prevention Network, we illustrate how our proposed analysis
facilitates the evaluation of candidate correlates of protection in terms of the
impacts of posited shifts in post-vaccination immunogenicity on disease risk.
